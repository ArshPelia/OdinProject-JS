Design the Game Board:

Visualize how you want your game board to look. Battleship typically uses an 8x8 grid.
In HTML, you can represent the board using a table or a grid layout.
Generate the Game Board Dynamically:

Use JavaScript to dynamically create the game board elements.
Each cell in the grid should have a unique identifier for easy manipulation.
Place Ships on the Board:

Define ships with different sizes (e.g., Carrier with size 5, Battleship with size 4, etc.).
Write a function to randomly place these ships on the board without overlapping.
This involves selecting a random starting point, deciding on the orientation (horizontal or vertical), and ensuring the ship fits within the board.
User Interaction:

Add event listeners to handle user clicks on the game board.
When a user clicks a cell, check if it's a hit or miss and update the display accordingly.
You may want to add visual cues for hits and misses, like changing the cell color.
Game Logic:

Implement the core game logic to track hits, misses, and sunk ships.
Maintain a count of hits, and when it equals the total number of ships, end the game.
Check if a clicked cell is a hit or miss by comparing it with the positions of the ships.
Styling:

Enhance the visual appeal of the game with CSS styles.
Use different colors to represent the game elements (e.g., cells, hits, misses).
Add hover effects to cells to provide a visual indication to the player.
Additional Features:

Consider adding features such as a reset button to start a new game.
Add animations or sound effects to make the game more engaging.
Implement difficulty levels or a scoring system.
